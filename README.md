Project forked from https://github.com/LeeKamentsky/python-javabridge

Used in the image analysis software [Cell-ACDC](https://github.com/SchmollerLab/Cell_ACDC).

The only difference from the original package is that this package automatically
downloads Java and JDK if not already installed on the target computer.

The javabridge Python package makes it easy to start a Java virtual machine (JVM) from Python and interact with it. Python code can interact with the JVM using a low-level API or a more convenient high-level API.
